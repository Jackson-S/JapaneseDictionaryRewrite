     * generate subset files.
     * The current values in this field are:
     * - news1/2: appears in the "wordfreq" file compiled by Alexandre Girardi
     * from the Mainichi Shimbun. (See the Monash ftp archive for a copy.)
     * Words in the first 12,000 in that file are marked "news1" and words
     * in the second 12,000 are marked "news2".
     * - ichi1/2: appears in the "Ichimango goi bunruishuu", Senmon Kyouiku
     * Publishing, Tokyo, 1998.  (The entries marked "ichi2" were
     * demoted from ichi1 because they were observed to have low
     * frequencies in the WWW and newspapers.)
     * - spec1 and spec2: a small number of words use this marker when they
     * are detected as being common, but are not included in other lists.
     * - gai1/2: common loanwords, based on the wordfreq file.
     * - nfxx: this is an indicator of frequency-of-use ranking in the
     * wordfreq file. "xx" is the number of the set of 500 words in which
     * the entry can be found, with "01" assigned to the first 500, "02"
     * to the second, and so on. (The entries with news1, ichi1, spec1, spec2
     * and gai1 values are marked with a "(P)" in the EDICT and EDICT2
     * files.)
     *
     * The reason both the kanji and reading elements are tagged is because
     * on occasions a priority is only associated with a particular
     * kanji/reading pair.
